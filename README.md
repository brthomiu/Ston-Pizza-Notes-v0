# Brad's 2023 Typescript Sandbox Project

This is a full stack webapp made to practice using TypeScript on a real project.

Features a Node/Express backend with a MongoDB cluster, and a React frontend.

I will update this readme once I finish building out basic functionality and decide what I am actually building.
